 He played a key role in the development of first ever indigenously developed Liquid propellant (LP) rocket engine for Prithvi missile.
 He was instrumental in productionization of highly complex LP engines at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and private industry. 
 His contribution in development of Cold and Hot gas Reaction Control systems led to better control of missile systems at higher altitudes, 
 thus increasing the accuracy of the missiles.  He played a vital role in the development of Propellant transfer systems and Storage
 facilities at various forward Army locations.  His
 dynamic leadership played a key role in providing training to Army personnel and support Induction process 
 for Prithvi missile into the Armed Forces arsenal.

 <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;position:relative;margin-left:15px;margin-top:10px;color:#990000;">Director's Message</h3>
 <p style="font-size:15px;color:#A09D9D;position:relative;margin-left:20px;margin-right:45px;">
 Being the Director of an ‘Institution of National Importance ‘is a matter of pride as well as a burden of responsibility. This position has been held by many stalwarts who have nurtured this institution to where it is today and given it a glorious past of over fifty years. Now, as the baton has passed on to me,
 I realize that it is for me to lay a roadmap that would take this institution to even greater heights.
 <br><br>
 NIT Kurukshetra has been successfully fulfilling its mandate of developing competent professionals 
 to serve not only our country, but the world as a whole. More than thirty thousand alumni proudly consider this institution their Alma Mater. Many of them have occupied important positions across the country and the globe and have made meaningful contributions to their professions and to advancing the quality of life through their innovative ideas. I applaud their contributions.
<br>
 <br>
 Located in Dharmkshetre Kurukshetre, where the good fought the evil and emerged successful, a stress on value-education should come naturally to this institution. For the present-day students who are targeting success in the material world, it is difficult, even confusing, to be receptive to the idea of inculcating ethics and values in their thinking and practice. But that cannot be a reason for not making it a part of the education we provide the budding professionals. I make no lofty claims in this regard, except that we are constantly gripped by the need to somehow make this a part of our teaching-learning process so
 that the outcome of this process is not only a competent professional but a compassionate human being.
 <br><br>
 I heartily welcome everyone who visits this website, to the portals of this institution!
 <br><br>
 Satish Kumar<br><br>
 Director </p>
